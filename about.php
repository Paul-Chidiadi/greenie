            <p>Trees are one of the greatest gift given to us by nature. Trees have lots of importance
                to humans and the world at large and we can not over emphasize how blessed we are to
                have this nature's gift. Trees are very essential starting from its contribution to 
                our environment by providing oxygen, improving air quality, climate amelioration, 
                conserving water, preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. Trees, shrubs and turf
                also filter air by removing dust and absorbing other pollutants like carbon monoxide,
                sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
                One of the most essential importance of trees is its ability to provide oxygen and 
                limit carbon in the atmosphere. According to research and studies, “One acre of forest
                absorbs six tons of carbon dioxide and puts out four tons of oxygen. This is enough to
                meet the annual needs of 18 people.” At <span><b>GREENIE</b></span> we educate and enlighten 
                people about the importance of trees as they help absorb and sink the carbon that would
                otherwise contribute to global heating. We inspire people to <span> <b> PLANT, NUTURE and 
                CELEBRATE </b> </span> 
                trees.
