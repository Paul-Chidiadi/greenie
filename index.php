            <p>Trees are one of the greatest gift given to us by nature. Trees have lots of importance
                to humans and the world at large and we can not over emphasize how blessed we are to
                have this nature's gift. Trees are very essential starting from its contribution to 
                our environment by providing oxygen, improving air quality, climate amelioration, 
                conserving water, preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. Trees, shrubs and turf
                also filter air by removing dust and absorbing other pollutants like carbon monoxide,
                sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. 
                One of the most essential importance of trees is its ability to provide oxygen and 
                limit carbon in the atmosphere. According to research and studies, “One acre of forest
                absorbs six tons of carbon dioxide and puts out four tons of oxygen. This is enough to
                meet the annual needs of 18 people.” At <span> <b>GREENIE</b> </span> we educate and enlighten 
                people about the importance of trees as they help absorb and sink the carbon that would
                otherwise contribute to global heating. We inspire people to <span> <b> PLANT, NUTURE and 
                CELEBRATE </b> </span> 
                trees.

        <p>Trees have supported and sustained life throughout our existence. They have a wide
            variety of practical and commercial uses. Did you know the bark of some trees can
            be made into cork and is a source of chemicals and medicines? Quinine and aspirin
            are both made from bark extracts. The inner bark of some trees contains latex, the
            main ingredient of rubber. How many more uses can you name?
            That’s why the more trees are out there, the better. Unfortunately, as areas of 
            forest the size of a football pitch are being lost every minute, we’re yet to get
            to the right track when it comes to forest protection and management. It is so 
            important that things go right. Support <b>GREENIE</b> by making donations today.
            Let's get it right this time!.
